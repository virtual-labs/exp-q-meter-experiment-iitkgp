- Set the Shunt Resistance (Rsh) value as small as possible (Say 0.02 Ohm). Set all the parameters (R, L, C) by yourself.
 </br>
- Set the voltage value of the oscillator (E=10 V).
 </br>
- At f=100 Hz. Check the value of voltage drop across capacitor. (EC).
 </br>
- Change the frequency until EC reach at the maximum value. Then calculate the value Q measured using this formula `Q_(meas)=(omega_0L)/(R+R_(sh))`.
 </br>
- Calculate the true value of unknown coil by using this formula `Q_(true)=(omega_0L)/R`
 </br>
- First resonance occurs due to frequency (say f1). Note down the value of tuning capacitor C. (say C1). Double the input frequency (f1) (say f2=2*f1). Change the tuning capacitor value until resonance occurs. Note down the value of tuning capacitor C. (say C2). Discharge capacitance (Cd) would be =(C1-4*C2)/3.
