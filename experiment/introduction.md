## Introduction

The determination of the storage factor Q is one of the most widely used means in the laboratory for testing radio frequency coils, inductors and capacitors. The storage factor is equal to `Q=(omega_0 L)/R` where `omega_0` is the resonant frequency, L is the inductance and R is the effective resistance of the a coil. The effective resistance R, is never determined directly since its value depends upon the value of frequency.
